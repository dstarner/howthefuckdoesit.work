# Computers

A computer is an electronic device that can process and store information. It works by following a set of instructions called a program, which tells it what to do.

The computer is made up of several components, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices (such as a keyboard and mouse), and storage devices (such as a hard drive).

When you turn on the computer, the CPU reads the instructions from the computer's memory and executes them. These instructions can include things like opening a program, playing a video, or browsing the internet.

When you type on the keyboard or move the mouse, the input devices send signals to the CPU, which then processes those signals and displays the results on the screen or sends output to other devices like a printer.

When you save a file, the computer stores it on a storage device like a hard drive so that you can access it later.

Overall, a computer works by following a set of instructions to process and store information, and it uses various components to input, process, and output that information.
