# Internet

The internet is a vast network of computers and other devices that are connected together. It works by allowing these devices to communicate with each other using a common language and set of rules known as protocols.

When you access the internet, your device sends a request to a server using the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the server. The server then processes the request and sends back a response to your device.

To send and receive information over the internet, your device needs to be connected to a network. This can be done through a wired or wireless connection, such as a modem, router, or Wi-Fi.

The internet is made up of many different types of networks, such as local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). These networks are connected through a series of routers, which direct traffic between them.

When you browse the web or use other internet services, you are accessing data that is stored on servers located all around the world. This data is sent to your device in small packets, which are reassembled by your device into the information you see on your screen.

Overall, the internet works by allowing devices to communicate with each other using a common language and set of rules, and by connecting networks together through a series of routers. This enables people all around the world to access and share information in real time.
